    <h2>What is a Real Life Vampire?</h2>
    <p>The vampire community is a complex identity group composed of various subsets based around one's self-identity with the concept of real vampirism and method of feeding. These individuals may be sanguinarian (blood drinkers), psychic (pranic) or energy feeding, tantric or sexual, or embrace spiritual beliefs that coalesce with their own personal vampirism. On one hand, a self-identified vampire may exhibit either physical or psychological illness while others may not present with any readily identifiable condition. Therein lies the enigma of the vampire community — participants identify as vampires for a myriad of reasons, and they represent a diverse spectrum of experience.</p>
    <p>Sanguinarian vampires feed by drinking blood — either human or animal. This type of vampire can vary in their experience of what some call “blood hunger.” But a unique craving for blood, and physical symptoms like weakness associated with neglecting to drink blood, are unifying features. Getting blood from human sources is through consensual agreement by verbal or written contract between a vampire and a donor.</p>
    <p>Psychic vampires feed off of what they term the subtle life-force energy (also called prana, chi, or qi) of an individual. This psychic feeding is usually from a willing individual, or from the ambient energies of a large group or crowd.</p>
